      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>Pollution Near Me is an open project to expose toxic sites, violations, and environmental risks. 
         We provide a public-facing interface for awareness while documenting the build process in a private ledger.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>Data sources include EPA datasets, AQI APIs, and other verifiable environmental feeds. 
         Every dataset is timestamped and reproducible.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Accountability</h2>
      <p>All changes are logged in a build ledger. No baselines are sealed until operational proof is verified.</p>
