=== PollutionNearMe Build Ledger ===
Entry 1
[2025-11-04 13:41 EST]
Event: Custom Domain Live, HTTPS Pending
Actions:
  • GitHub repository "pollutionnearme" created (public).
  • index.html committed with starter landing page.
  • GitHub Pages enabled at hanksterner.github.io/pollutionnearme/.
  • Custom domain pollutionnearme.org bound successfully.
  • DNS verified: four A records (@) → GitHub Pages IPs.
  • DNS verified: CNAME (www) → hanksterner.github.io.
  • Site resolves correctly at pollutionnearme.org.
  • GitHub Pages reports: "Certificate not yet issued."
Status: Candidate baseline live at custom domain, awaiting TLS provisioning.
Next Ritual: Monitor DNS propagation; enable "Enforce HTTPS" once certificate is issued.
Seal: Not yet — pending operational proof of HTTPS enforcement.

Entry 2
[2025-11-04 14:50 EST]
Event: HTTPS Enforced
Actions:
  • TLS certificate issued by GitHub Pages / Let’s Encrypt.
  • "Enforce HTTPS" enabled in repository Pages settings.
  • All traffic to pollutionnearme.org and www.pollutionnearme.org now redirects securely to HTTPS.
Status: Candidate baseline hardened with encryption; site is live and secure.
Next Ritual: Establish site scaffold (core routes and placeholders) to prepare for functional content.
Seal: Not yet — pending operational proof of scaffold and first data integration.

Entry 3
[2025-11-04 14:54 EST]
Event: Build Plan Established
Actions:
  • Formalized multi‑phase build plan to guide development of PollutionNearMe.
  • Plan includes site scaffold, data integration, brand identity, functional expansion, and public launch ritual.
  • Documented phases and actions for reproducibility and public accountability.
Status: Build plan logged; execution to proceed phase by phase with ledger updates at significant milestones.
Next Ritual: Begin Phase 1 — Site Skeleton Baseline (create placeholder routes and navigation).
Seal: Not yet — pending operational proof of scaffold deployment.
------------------------------------------------------------

=== PollutionNearMe Build Plan ===
Phase 1: Site Skeleton Baseline
  • Create minimal placeholder pages:
      - / → Landing page with mission statement.
      - /about → Purpose, credibility, and context.
      - /logs → Public ledger (already seeded).
      - /data → Placeholder for pollution data interface.
  • Add simple navigation linking these routes.
  • Commit and verify all routes resolve without 404s.

Phase 2: Data Integration Candidate
  • Define the YuE‑Interface container baseline for pollution data ingestion.
  • Connect /data route to a placeholder API response (mock JSON).
  • Log first operational proof of data output.

Phase 3: Brand & Identity Layer
  • Apply consistent design language (colors, typography, logo).
  • Add metadata for SEO and social sharing.
  • Harden copy to align with the project’s ritual tone.

Phase 4: Functional Expansion
  • Integrate live pollution data sources (e.g., AQI APIs).
  • Build interactive map or charts for /data.
  • Add user‑facing features (search by location, shareable reports).

Phase 5: Public Launch Ritual
  • Seal baseline once reproducibility and HTTPS stability are proven.
  • Announce via ledger, social channels, and brand assets.
  • Begin iterative updates with strict ledger documentation.

Entry 4
[2025-11-04 20:36 EST]
Event: Site Skeleton Baseline Established
Actions:
  • index.html, about.html, and data.html created with consistent structure and shared navigation.
  • nav.html introduced as single source of truth for navigation; dynamically included across all pages.
  • css/style.css and js/app.js linked to all pages for styling and future interactivity.
  • Verified that /, /about, and /data routes resolve without 404s under HTTPS.
Status: Scaffold operational; multi‑page structure reproducible and consistent.
Next Ritual: Prepare Phase 2 — Data Integration Candidate (connect /data to placeholder JSON feed).
Seal: Not yet — pending operational proof of data output.
------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 5
[2025-11-04 21:32 EST]
Event: Data Integration Candidate
Actions:
  • Created /data/placeholder.json with mock AQI values.
  • Updated js/app.js to fetch and render JSON into <pre id="data-output">.
  • Verified operational proof: /data page displays structured JSON in browser.
Status: Candidate baseline for data output established; reproducible under HTTPS.
Next Ritual: Advance to Phase 3 — Brand & Identity Layer (apply design language, metadata, and ritual copy hardening).
Seal: Not yet — pending integration of live EPA data sources and validation of reproducibility.
