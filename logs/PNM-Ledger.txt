Phase 2: Data Integration Candidate
  • Define the YuE‑Interface container baseline for pollution data ingestion.
  • Connect /data route to a placeholder API response (mock JSON).
  • Log first operational proof of data output.

Phase 3: Brand & Identity Layer
  • Apply consistent design language (colors, typography, logo).
  • Add metadata for SEO and social sharing.
  • Harden copy to align with the project’s ritual tone.

Phase 4: Functional Expansion
  • Integrate live pollution data sources (e.g., AQI APIs).
  • Build interactive map or charts for /data.
  • Add user‑facing features (search by location, shareable reports).

Phase 5: Public Launch Ritual
  • Seal baseline once reproducibility and HTTPS stability are proven.
  • Announce via ledger, social channels, and brand assets.
  • Begin iterative updates with strict ledger documentation.

• Verified operational proof: /data page now renders AQI, TRI, and Violations without console errors.
• Observed TRI feed populating correctly from data/tri.json.
• Initiated conceptual refinement: shift from raw technical tables toward citizen‑facing storytelling.
   - Replace jargon (e.g., “TRI”, “release_lbs”) with plain language (“Toxic Releases”, “Pollution released (pounds)”).
   - Contextualize numbers with relatable scales (e.g., “20 lbs ≈ weight of a car tire”, “19,530 lbs ≈ 10 pickup trucks”).
   - Apply severity color‑coding (green/yellow/red) and icons (factories, hazard symbols).
   - Frame data locally: “Your Area: [City] — Air quality is Good today, but factories released 19,530 lbs of toxic chemicals last year.”
   - Add actionable takeaways: “What this means for you” sections after each dataset.
Status: Technical fix sealed; conceptual refinement logged as guiding principle for presentation layer.
Next Ritual: Implement citizen‑friendly HTML blocks in data.html to replace raw JSON dumps with plain‑language summaries, icons, and contextual comparisons.

   – Violations & Fines (enforcement actions and penalties).
   – Superfund Sites (official term retained, deeper explanation deferred to FAQ).
• Removed AQI from snapshot section for MVP, as AQI is local/regional and constantly changing.
• Identified duplication of snapshot sections in index.html; one will be deleted in next update to streamline layout.
