Event: Build Plan Established
Actions:
  • Formalized multi‑phase build plan to guide development of PollutionNearMe.
  • Plan includes site scaffold, data integration, brand identity, functional expansion, and public launch ritual.

Next Ritual: Begin Phase 1 — Site Skeleton Baseline (create placeholder routes and navigation).
Seal: Not yet — pending operational proof of scaffold deployment.
------------------------------------------------------------

=== PollutionNearMe Build Plan ===
Phase 1: Site Skeleton Baseline
  • Create minimal placeholder pages:
      - / → Landing page with mission statement.
      - /about → Purpose, credibility, and context.
      - /logs → Public ledger (already seeded).
      - /data → Placeholder for pollution data interface.
  • Add simple navigation linking these routes.
  • Commit and verify all routes resolve without 404s.

Phase 2: Data Integration Candidate
  • Define the YuE‑Interface container baseline for pollution data ingestion.
  • Connect /data route to a placeholder API response (mock JSON).
  • Log first operational proof of data output.

Phase 3: Brand & Identity Layer
  • Apply consistent design language (colors, typography, logo).
  • Add metadata for SEO and social sharing.
  • Harden copy to align with the project’s ritual tone.

Phase 4: Functional Expansion
  • Integrate live pollution data sources (e.g., AQI APIs).
  • Build interactive map or charts for /data.
  • Add user‑facing features (search by location, shareable reports).

Phase 5: Public Launch Ritual
  • Seal baseline once reproducibility and HTTPS stability are proven.
  • Announce via ledger, social channels, and brand assets.
  • Begin iterative updates with strict ledger documentation.

Entry 7
[2025-11-04 22:36 EST]
Event: Data Strategy Baseline Established
Actions:
  • Defined core data categories for integration:
      - Air Quality Index (AQI): hourly/daily values, pollutant breakdowns.
      - Toxic Release Inventory (TRI): facility-level chemical release reports.
      - Violation & Enforcement Data: Clean Air/Water/RCRA violations, inspections, penalties.
      - Superfund/Hazardous Sites: location, cleanup status, risk categories.
      - Water Quality: Safe Drinking Water Act compliance, contaminant levels.
  • Identified optional/future layers: greenhouse gas reporting, noise/light pollution, community health indicators.
  • Established Phase 4 candidate set: AQI + TRI + Violations as initial visualization focus.
  • Confirmed each category has clear units, thresholds, and natural visual mappings (time series, bar charts, leaderboards, maps).
Status: Data strategy baseline sealed; all future visualization and integration work will reference this schema.
Next Ritual: Phase 4 — Data Visualization Candidate (implement charts/tables for AQI, TRI, and Violations using placeholder feeds).
Seal: Complete.

Entry 8
[2025-11-05 16:14 EST]
Event: Phase 4 Execution Plan — Data Visualization Candidate
Actions:
  • Selected core categories for visualization: AQI, TRI, and Violations (per Entry 7 baseline).
  • Defined presentation strategy:
      - AQI → bar/line charts showing current values and trends, color‑coded by thresholds (green/red).
      - TRI → bar charts by chemical/facility, sortable tables for annual totals.
      - Violations → leaderboards/tables by facility or region, highlighting counts and penalties.
  • Established dual‑layer display:
      - Raw JSON remains visible for transparency.
      - Charts/tables provide elegant, jargon‑free summaries for readability.
  • Chosen Chart.js as lightweight, responsive library for initial candidate visuals.
  • Planned table styling with consistent headers, borders, and neutral colors for clarity.
Status: Execution plan sealed; ready to implement chart and table scaffolds in data.html and app.js.
Next Ritual: Implement AQI placeholder chart + table as first operational proof of visualization layer.
