    <h2>Predictions Al Gore Got Right ✅</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rising CO₂ levels:</strong> Gore warned about atmospheric carbon climbing past historic thresholds. Today, CO₂ has surpassed 420 ppm, compared to ~280 ppm before 1900.</li>
      <li><strong>Global warming trend:</strong> Average global temperatures have risen ~1°C since 2006, consistent with his warnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Melting glaciers and ice sheets:</strong> Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of billions of tons of ice annually.</li>
      <li><strong>Sea level rise:</strong> Gore predicted rising seas; since 2006, global sea levels have risen ~3 inches, already causing “sunny day flooding” in Miami.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Predictions That Missed the Mark ❌</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ice-free Arctic by 2013:</strong> Gore suggested the Arctic Ocean could lose all summer ice by 2013. In reality, 2023 minimum ice extent was still ~4.23 million km².</li>
      <li><strong>Near-term catastrophic flooding of cities:</strong> Gore’s visuals of New York and Miami underwater were exaggerated. While flooding risks have increased, these cities remain above water.</li>
      <li><strong>Hurricane frequency:</strong> The film implied more frequent hurricanes. Data since then shows frequency has not increased, though intensity of some storms has.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Still Undetermined Climate Outcomes 🤔</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ice-free Arctic timeline:</strong> Current models project a summer ice-free Arctic between 2040–2060, decades later than Gore’s forecast.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term sea level rise:</strong> Gore warned of up to 20 feet “in the near future.” Scientists now expect 1–2 feet by 2100 under moderate emissions, but multi-meter rise remains possible over centuries.</li>
      <li><strong>Climate refugees:</strong> Gore spoke of mass displacement. While millions are already affected by flooding and drought, the scale he warned of (hundreds of millions to a billion) is still unfolding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Nearly 20 years later, Gore’s central message — that unchecked emissions drive dangerous climate change — holds true. But his timelines were often too aggressive, and some scenarios remain uncertain. The inconvenient truth is that the crisis is slower-moving than Gore’s imagery suggested, yet still accelerating toward outcomes that could reshape the planet.</p>
