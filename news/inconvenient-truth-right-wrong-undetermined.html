      <!-- Introductory paragraph -->
      <p class="intro">
        Nearly two decades ago, Al Gore’s <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> shook audiences with urgent warnings of a
        planet in peril.
        The film’s dramatic imagery and dire forecasts sparked debate, inspired activism, and set the stage for climate
        change as a mainstream political issue.
        Today, with the benefit of hindsight and hard data, we can ask: which of Gore’s predictions proved prescient,
        which overshot the mark, and which remain unresolved?
        This post revisits those claims, separating the accurate signals from the exaggerated noise, and exploring what
        they mean for our future.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Predictions Al Gore Got Right</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising CO₂ levels:</strong> Gore warned about atmospheric carbon climbing past historic
            thresholds. Today, CO₂ has surpassed 420 ppm, compared to ~280 ppm before 1900.</li>
          <li><strong>Global warming trend:</strong> Average global temperatures have risen ~1°C since 2006, consistent
            with his warnings.</li>
          <li><strong>Melting glaciers and ice sheets:</strong> Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of billions
            of tons of ice annually.</li>
          <li><strong>Sea level rise:</strong> Gore predicted rising seas; since 2006, global sea levels have risen ~3
            inches, already causing “sunny day flooding” in Miami.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Predictions That Missed the Mark</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ice-free Arctic by 2013:</strong> Gore suggested the Arctic Ocean could lose all summer ice by
            2013. In reality, 2023 minimum ice extent was still ~4.23 million km².</li>
          <li><strong>Near-term catastrophic flooding of cities:</strong> Gore’s visuals of New York and Miami
            underwater were exaggerated. While flooding risks have increased, these cities remain above water.</li>
          <li><strong>Hurricane frequency:</strong> The film implied more frequent hurricanes. Data since then shows
            frequency has not increased, though intensity of some storms has.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Still Undetermined Climate Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ice-free Arctic timeline:</strong> Current models project a summer ice-free Arctic between
            2040–2060, decades later than Gore’s forecast.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term sea level rise:</strong> Gore warned of up to 20 feet “in the near future.” Scientists
            now expect 1–2 feet by 2100 under moderate emissions, but multi-meter rise remains possible over centuries.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Climate refugees:</strong> Gore spoke of mass displacement. While millions are already affected by
            flooding and drought, the scale he warned of (hundreds of millions to a billion) is still unfolding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        <p>
          Nearly 20 years later, Gore’s central message — that unchecked emissions drive dangerous climate change —
          holds true.
          But his timelines were often too aggressive, and some scenarios remain uncertain.
          The inconvenient truth is that the crisis is slower-moving than Gore’s imagery suggested, yet still
          accelerating toward outcomes that could reshape the planet.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Closing paragraph -->
      <p class="closing">
        The lesson is clear: while timelines may falter, the trajectory of climate change is undeniable.
        Gore’s warnings remind us that imperfect forecasts can still illuminate urgent truths.
        As the world continues to grapple with rising seas, shifting weather, and the human toll of displacement, the
        challenge is not to debate whether the crisis is real — but to decide how boldly we will act.
        The inconvenient truth is that the future remains unwritten, and our choices today will determine whether it
        becomes a story of resilience or regret.
