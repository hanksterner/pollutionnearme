            <p class="intro">
                Imagine a world where climate change doesn’t just reshape coastlines or melt glaciers — it reshapes us.
                What if
                humans mirrored the Earth’s symptoms in our own bodies? Rising temperatures would flush our skin and
                raise our
                internal heat. Melting ice would drip from our shoulders, erasing memory and stability. Cracks would
                form across our
                chest like fractured terrain. Smoke would curl from our breath. Water would swell around our feet. And
                the symbols
                of our culture — tattoos, markings, language — would begin to fade.
            </p>

                <h2>Earth’s Symptoms, Mapped to the Human Body</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fever:</strong> Global temperatures have risen ~1°C since 2006. Earth runs hot — just as
                        a body does
                        when fighting infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Melting ice:</strong> Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of billions of tons
                        of ice
                        annually. Memory and stability dissolve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cracked terrain:</strong> Droughts and heatwaves fracture soil. In humans, this would be
                        fissures
                        across the skin — signs of structural breakdown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rising seas:</strong> Since 2006, global sea levels have risen ~3 inches, already
                        flooding Miami
                        streets. In our bodies, this would be swelling, fluid retention, pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoke and emissions:</strong> Air pollution clouds cities and lungs. Symbolically, it
                        would cloud our
                        thoughts, speech, and breath.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biodiversity loss:</strong> Species vanish. In humans, this would be the fading of
                        cultural memory —
                        imagination narrowing, diversity of thought collapsing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why This Allegory Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    We respond to bodily symptoms with urgency. A fever, swelling, or memory loss sends us to the
                    doctor. But when the
                    Earth shows these same signs, we debate, delay, and deflect. This metaphor isn’t science — it’s a
                    mirror. It asks
                    us to feel the crisis, not just measure it.
                </p>

                <h2>Grounding the Metaphor in Data</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>CO₂ levels have surpassed 420 ppm — up from ~280 ppm before 1900.</li>
                    <li>Sea level rise is accelerating, with projections of 1–2 feet by 2100 under moderate emissions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Arctic ice is shrinking, with summer ice-free conditions expected between 2040–2060.</li>
                    <li>Species extinction rates are climbing, with ecosystems destabilizing worldwide.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Closing Reflection</h2>
                <p class="closing">
                    The Earth’s body is showing symptoms we cannot ignore. Fever. Swelling. Memory loss. Structural
                    cracks. If these
                    signs appeared in our own bodies, we’d act immediately. The inconvenient truth is that the planet is
                    sick — and we
                    are both the cause and the cure. Our choices today will determine whether this story becomes one of
                    resilience or
                    regret.
