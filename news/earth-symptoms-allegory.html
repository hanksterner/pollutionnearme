      <p class="intro">
        Imagine a world where climate change doesn’t just reshape coastlines or melt glaciers — it reshapes us.
        What if humans mirrored the Earth’s symptoms in our own bodies? Rising temperatures would flush our skin
        and raise our internal heat. Melting ice would drip from our shoulders, erasing memory and stability.
        Cracks would form across our chest like fractured terrain. Smoke would curl from our breath. Water would
        swell around our feet. And the symbols of our culture — tattoos, markings, language — would begin to fade.
      </p>

      <h2>Earth’s Symptoms, Mapped to the Human Body</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fever:</strong> Global temperatures have risen ~1°C since 2006. Earth runs hot — just as a body does
          when fighting infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Melting ice:</strong> Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of billions of tons of ice
          annually. Memory and stability dissolve.</li>
        <li><strong>Cracked terrain:</strong> Droughts and heatwaves fracture soil. In humans, this would be fissures
          across the skin — signs of structural breakdown.</li>
        <li><strong>Rising seas:</strong> Since 2006, global sea levels have risen ~3 inches, already flooding Miami
          streets. In our bodies, this would be swelling, fluid retention, pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoke and emissions:</strong> Air pollution clouds cities and lungs. Symbolically, it would cloud
          our thoughts, speech, and breath.</li>
        <li><strong>Biodiversity loss:</strong> Species vanish. In humans, this would be the fading of cultural memory —
          imagination narrowing, diversity of thought collapsing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Allegory Matters</h2>
      <p>
        We respond to bodily symptoms with urgency. A fever, swelling, or memory loss sends us to the doctor.
        But when the Earth shows these same signs, we debate, delay, and deflect. This metaphor isn’t science —
        it’s a mirror. It asks us to feel the crisis, not just measure it.
      </p>

      <h2>Grounding the Metaphor in Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CO₂ levels have surpassed 420 ppm — up from ~280 ppm before 1900.</li>
        <li>Sea level rise is accelerating, with projections of 1–2 feet by 2100 under moderate emissions.</li>
        <li>Arctic ice is shrinking, with summer ice-free conditions expected between 2040–2060.</li>
        <li>Species extinction rates are climbing, with ecosystems destabilizing worldwide.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="closing">
        The Earth’s body is showing symptoms we cannot ignore. Fever. Swelling. Memory loss. Structural cracks.
        If these signs appeared in our own bodies, we’d act immediately. The inconvenient truth is that the planet
        is sick — and we are both the cause and the cure. Our choices today will determine whether this story
        becomes one of resilience or regret.
