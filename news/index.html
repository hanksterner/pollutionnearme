      <h3>Nearly Half of Americans Breathe Unhealthy Air, Report Finds</h3>
      <p><em>November 09, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        The American Lung Association’s <em>State of the Air 2025</em> report shows that almost half of the U.S.
        population is exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. <strong>156 million Americans</strong> live in
        counties that received failing grades for ozone or particle pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extreme heat and wildfires continue to worsen air quality, leading to more asthma attacks, heart problems, and
        low birth weight in babies. The report also highlights inequality: people of color are more than twice as likely
        as white residents to live in communities with failing grades for all three pollution measures.

      <h3>What Is the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)?</h3>
      <p><em>November 10, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a program run by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Created in 1986
        under the Emergency Planning and Community Right‑to‑Know Act, it requires thousands of facilities to report
        annual releases of certain toxic chemicals into the air, water, and land.
      </p>
      <p>
        TRI’s purpose is transparency: by making this information public, communities, researchers, and policymakers can
        see where pollution is happening and how much is being released. The data helps track trends, push for pollution
        prevention, and hold companies accountable.

      <h3>What Is the National Priorities List (Superfund Sites)?</h3>
      <p><em>November 11, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        The National Priorities List (NPL) is the U.S. government’s list of the most serious hazardous waste sites,
        commonly referred to as “Superfund sites.” The EPA uses the NPL to decide which contaminated places need
        long‑term cleanup. Sites are added after investigation shows they pose a risk to human health or the
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are more than a thousand sites currently on the list, ranging from abandoned factories to landfills and
        military bases. Some have been cleaned up and removed, while new sites are added each year.
