        <p class="intro">The air isn’t the only thing clouded. In the final week of COP30, as delegates debated fossil
            fuel
            phase‑outs and forest protections, another kind of pollution thickened the room: disinformation. It didn’t
            rise
            from smokestacks or tailpipes, but from headlines, hashtags, and policy drafts. And like smog, it obscures
            visibility, corrodes trust, and delays response.</p>

        <h2>The Invisible Pollutant</h2>
        <p>Disinformation behaves like particulate matter. It’s fine‑grained, hard to detect, and deeply inhaled. It
            settles
            into public discourse, distorting perception and paralyzing action. At COP30, ten nations endorsed a
            declaration
            to combat climate disinformation — a symbolic first step toward narrative cleanup. But the smog is thick,
            and
            the cleanup has only begun.</p>

        <h2>Sources of Narrative Smog</h2>
        <p>Much like industrial emissions, disinformation has traceable sources. Lobby‑backed campaigns reframe
            extraction
            as “transition.” Think tank reports launder biased metrics into mainstream coverage. Algorithms amplify
            outrage
            over evidence. And cherry‑picked data — stripped of context — becomes the exhaust of denial.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>When visibility is low, collisions happen. Policy stalls. Public trust erodes. Climate action becomes a foggy
            road with no signage. The damage isn’t just reputational — it’s existential. Every delay in mitigation,
            every
            diluted agreement, every false equivalence costs lives, ecosystems, and time we don’t have.</p>

        <h2>Clearing the Air</h2>
        <p>Just as we monitor PM2.5 and ozone, we must track narrative toxins. That means demanding transparency in
            sourcing, methodology, and incentives. It means favoring primary data over viral threads. And it means
            treating
            information integrity as a public health issue — because it is.</p>

        <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
        <p>Check provenance. Who authored the claim? What’s the data, the method, the motive? Favor studies,
            inventories,
            and direct sources. Share with context — not just headlines. And when in doubt, ask: is this clearing the
            air,
            or thickening the smog?</p>

        <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Disinformation is pollution. It may not choke your lungs, but it chokes progress. At COP30, the world took
            its
            first official breath toward cleaner climate narratives. Let’s make sure it’s not the last.</p>
